                <p style="font-family:Candara;color:rgb(58, 55, 55) ;">SheeshMahal is a phenomenal place with exquisite and magnificent surroundings amidst the Aravalli Range, combining luxury, nature, and comfort in every way. This place is unlike any other, with an immaculate setting, chirping birds singing the song of the sound of the soil, where pure air abounds, and one soul finds peace.
                        What makes this property even more appealing is that it was created, architected, designed, and built by the owner himself, Mr. Bhagat Singh Lohagarh, who himself is a creative appreciator and creator of art. Belonging to the royal bloodline of Bharatpur’s Silsilwars, he has only been able to do justice to the resort’s creation, keeping history and culture alive and making it resemble nothing less than a kingdom.
                        Not only does the resort’s creator have historical origins, but the fort as well, making it even more distinctive and unique. According to a Rajpurohit, 300 years ago, the king’s daughter and a banyan tree were betrothed since it is regarded to be auspicious in Hindu traditions.
                        The 300-year-old banyan tree, the oldest in Rajasthan, still stands, with excellent health and humongous roots. According to the forest authorities, this ancient tree is extremely uncommon and unique, and it is not found in Rajasthan. The trees contribute spiritually to the atmosphere and convey optimism, which is palpable.
                        Not only is it an ideal place to stay, but its architecture and design make it an excellent venue for a royal wedding. The essence of grandeur provided by this location is absolutely immaculate and astounding. The nooks and corners of this estate have been developed and refurbished with exquisite planning to fulfill the customs and desires of proper traditional marriage and make it even more auspicious.<p>

               <h3>Where Luxury Meets traditions:</h3> <p style="font-family:Candara;color:rgb(58, 55, 55) ;">
                    The estate starts with the MUKHYA DWAR, which is outfitted with Jharokhas and Chhatris and is surrounded by a 22-foot-high border wall that prioritizes security.According to Hindu traditions, the KUMHER DWAR, located between two JANWASAS, is the principal entry point for the Baraat and associated rites such as Banayi and Chadhayi. SheeshMahal gives complete security and seclusion to the baraat from the Mukhya Dwar to the Kumher Dwar, which has not been witnessed in any other resort.

                    We have two “Janwasas” for our guests’ convenience; one for the women, “Kishori Mahal”, where they may gain their own solitude and slumber according to their comfort, and one for the males, Khasmahal, where they can have their own leisure time.
                    Sehra Chatri is located just outside the entrance door, but inside the “Mukhya Dwar.” This is an old tradition in which the groom wears a Sehra(called Sehra bandi) on his head while getting ready to marry, and it is done on the wedding day.
                    With the primary goal of security in mind, Shahi Road was built with a 300 m gap between “Mukhya Dwaar” and “Kumher Gate” for performing an old tradition known as Baraat, in which the groom sits on the horse to ride to the wedding destination to perform the wedding.
                    Just inside the Mukhya Dwar, there is a VIP lounge named “Baradari” where visitors may rest and enjoy the rituals performed in the baraat at their ease.</p>
